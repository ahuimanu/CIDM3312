@* I have revealed the Server JS code so that you can download and run the project code.

Notes on how to use the endpoints are in the README for the CIDM3372/Project folder in the repo: https://github.com/ahuimanu/CIDM3372/tree/master/Project


For the sunrise/sunset endpoint, try different lat/lon combos
For the addsmetar, here is a list of ICAO codes for airports around the world: https://www.airport-data.com/world-airports/icao-code/A.html
I will next reveal most of the client-side JS code and make it clear what you are expected to fill in.
In the interest of a more complete example, I am leaving you not more than 5% of the work to complete. *@
